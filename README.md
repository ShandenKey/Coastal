# I Like Big Trees 

Executive Summary
Using data from National Parks pages and weather data, we will look into factors that dictate how to plot YOUR perfect visit to the California Giants, the Sequoias and the Redwoods.
Motivation
After visiting Redwood National Park over a 2 day drive, returning to spend more time there  and exploring the surrounding area has been a goal. 
Data Question
Is there a way to design a “perfect” trip  to California with a particular emphasis on seeing the Coastal Redwoods and or the Giant Sequoias? 
•	What is the best time of year to visit based on temperature?
•	What is the best time of year to visit based on precipitation?
•	What are visitor numbers to the parks, when is it busiest?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Slide and Tableau walk through of influencing factors, filterable, to help plot a trip to see the California Giants.

2.	Clean & Explore the Data (Dec8)
3.	Create Presentation of your Analysis (“finished”Dec13)
4.	Internal demos (<Dec15)
5.	Demo Day!! (<Jan 4>)

Data Sources
•	National Parks pages : Portal - Welcome to IRMA (nps.gov) (specifically: STATS - Welcome to Visitor Use Statistics (nps.gov) )
•	Climate.gov
Known Issues and Challenges
•	Secondary data website scraping, most sites (pow-wow and flower festival sites specifically) don’t have descriptive coding so scraping is nearly impossible.
•	Information from climate.gov must be requested for each location, have to pull & request early to make sure I get the right information.
•	Some National Park data is in excel or “report” format, not standard csv, so need to be standardized.
