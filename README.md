# Coastal 

Using data from National Parks pages, weather data, and travel/lodging sites, we will go over the overriding factors that dictate how to plot YOUR perfect week long visit to the California Redwoods.
Motivation
After visiting Redwood National Park over a 2 day drive, returning to spend more time there  and exploring the surrounding area has been a goal. 

Data Question:
Is there a way to design a “perfect” week long trip along the California coast with a particular emphasis on seeing the Coastal Redwoods? 
•	What is the best time of year to visit: based on weather and park visitation numbers.
•	Is it “better” to drive South to North or North to South based on tree size, i.e. where are the biggest redwoods?
•	If you are adding more days, what other drivable parks have the “best” attractions: endangered/interesting flora & fauna, environmental(natural) attractions, tourist destinations, lodgings. 

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Tableau/PowerBI(not sure which yet) walk through of influencing factors, filterable, to help plot a drive through the Coastal Redwoods, extended to include other points of interest for a week long trip.
